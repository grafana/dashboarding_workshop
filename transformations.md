# Transformations
[Transformations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/transform-data/) are a powerful way to manipulate data returned by a query before the system applies a visualization. Using transformations, you can:
- Rename fields
- Join time series/SQL-like data
- Perform mathematical operations across queries
- Use the output of one transformation as the input to another transformation
