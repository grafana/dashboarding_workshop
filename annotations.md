# Annotations

[Annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) provide a way to mark points on a visualization with rich events. They are visualized as vertical lines and icons on all graph panels. When you hover over an annotation, you can get event description and event tags. The text field can include links to other systems with more detail.<br/>

### Annotation 1 & 2
We will now set the first of three types of annotations. <br/>
For the first annotation, hold Ctrl/Cmd and click+drag over an area of the Timeseries panel:<br/>

So that it looks something like this:<br/>

<br/><br/>
Then, pick a single time point, and click on it to set another annotation, eg:<br/>

<br/><br/>
Notice how how you can hover your mouse over an annotation to get more detail about that region:<br/>
