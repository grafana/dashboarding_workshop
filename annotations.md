# Annotations

[Annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) provide a way to mark points on a visualization with rich events. They are visualized as vertical lines and icons on all graph panels. When you hover over an annotation, you can get event description and event tags. The text field can include links to other systems with more detail.<br/>
